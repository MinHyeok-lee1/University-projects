# AICamera

This project was developed as part of a university research initiative, focusing on computer vision and deep learning-based object detection using real-time IP cameras.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time video stream processing from IP cameras
- Object detection with OpenCV and deep learning models
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Multiple model testing and evaluation (XGBoost, CNN, etc.)
- Notebook experiments and model performance tracking

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- IP camera integration

## 📁 Notable Files

- `detecting_AI_*.py` – Scripts for different object detection approaches
- `REAL_FINAL_*.ipynb` – Final notebook experiments
- `keras_model.h5` – Pre-trained model weights
- `cv.py`, `multi.py` – Supporting modules for processing
